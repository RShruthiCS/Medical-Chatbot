# 🩺 Medical Chatbot (Guided Project)

This repository contains a guided project where I built a simple **Medical Chatbot** using Python and machine learning.  
The chatbot can answer basic medical-related questions by matching user input with trained intents and providing an appropriate response.

This project helped me practice:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Using neural networks for text classification
- Working with JSON-based intent datasets
- Building a simple chat interface

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies user messages into predefined medical intents  
- Provides helpful responses based on trained patterns  
- Uses a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Includes data preprocessing using tokenization and lemmatization  
- Interactive chat mode for testing the model

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NLTK**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
